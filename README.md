### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge, which I push to my github. At first I thought this task would be much easier, but I supposed that is only lack of experience. The most challenging task to do was arrangement of elements in the card. First I try to use flexbox, but I've got problems with giving the correct position to the img.
